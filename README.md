Coursera programming languages part A 
Coursera Programming Languages  This course is an introduction to the basic concepts of programming languages, 
with a strong emphasis on functional programming. The course uses the languages ML, Racket, and Ruby as vehicles 
for teaching the concepts, but the real intent is to teach enough about how any language “fits together” to make you 
more effective programming in any language -- and in learning new ones.
